This extension provides Language Server for Windows batch scripts.
Besides, it also provides useful *snippets* for these files.

## Go to/peek definition

It's possible to peek definition of a label or go directly to it's declaration.

## Peek references

You can peek all references of a label or a variable. The search scope is only the current file. In other words: it does not look for a variable on other batch scripts.
